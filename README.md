# Minesweeper
Minesweeper in C++ using classes and graphics in X11.
This Minesweeper game was coded for a school final project. We were provided with gfx2.h and gfx2.o, which contain functions
for creating the graphics using X11. The zone.h and zone.cpp files contain the methods of the zone class, which refers to each 
individual square on the minesweeper board. The board.h and board.cpp files contain the methods of the board class, which 
refers to the board as a whole, containing a two-dimensional vector of zones.
